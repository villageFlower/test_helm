Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:\nA. It is too computationally expensive.\nB. It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset.\nC.
