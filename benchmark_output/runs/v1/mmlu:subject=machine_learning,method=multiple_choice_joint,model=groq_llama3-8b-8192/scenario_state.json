From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:\nA. It is too computationally expensive.\nB. It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset.\nC. It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset.\nD.
