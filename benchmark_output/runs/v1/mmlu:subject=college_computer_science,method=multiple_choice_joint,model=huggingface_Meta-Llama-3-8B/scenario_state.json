Write-back is a policy whereby a write operation to a line found in the cache does not affect main memory until the line is evicted from the cache. Write-allocation is a policy whereby a cache line is allocated and loaded on a write-miss. If it is assumed that write-allocation is always used, which of the following is true?\nA. Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.\nB. Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.\nC. The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.\nD.
