Plasma membrane\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013ribosome\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013rough ER\nB. Ribosome\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013rough ER\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013plasma membrane\nC. Plasma membrane\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013ribosome\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013rough ER\nD. Ribosome\u2013rough ER\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013plasma membrane\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is not known to be involved in the control of cell division?\nA. Cyclins\nB. Protein kinases\nC. Checkpoints\nD. Fibroblast cells\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme\u2019s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity?\nA. By changing the enzyme\u2019s pH optimum\nB. By changing the enzyme\u2019s location in the cell\nC. By changing the shape of the protein\nD. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity.\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Homologous structures are often cited as evidence for the process of natural selection. All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT\nA. the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat\nB. the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man\nC. the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal\nD. the forelegs of an insect and the forelimbs of a dog\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?\nA. Translation\nB. Conjugation\nC. Specialized transduction\nD. Transformation\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: The upper forelimbs of humans and bats have fairly similar skeletal structures, whereas the corresponding bones in whales have very different shapes and proportions. However, genetic data suggest that all three kinds of organisms diverged from a common ancestor at about the same time. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these data?\nA. Humans and bats evolved by natural selection, and whales evolved by Lamarckian mechanisms.\nB. Forelimb evolution was adaptive in people and bats, but not in whales.\nC. Natural selection in an aquatic environment resulted in significant changes to whale forelimb anatomy.\nD. Genes mutate faster in whales than in humans or bats.\nAnswer only the last question with a single letter only and put your final answer between <RESULT></RESULT> tag, output exactly the same as the tag I provided and do not say anything else other than the tag and your answer.",
