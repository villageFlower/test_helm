The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD. Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n\nA. I, II\nB. II, III\nC. III, I\nD. III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: The midterm scores for a statistics course were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 52 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. The final exam scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 112 points and a standard deviation of 10 points. One student had a score of 58 points on the midterm. If she had the same standardized score (z-score) on the final exam, what must her score have been?\nA. 15 points\nB. 58 points\nC. 118 points\nD. 127 points\nAnswer only the last question with a single letter only and put your final answer between <RESULT></RESULT> tag, output exactly the same as the tag I provided and do not say anything else other than the tag and your answer.",

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD.

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: An experiment is conducted in which the response variable is the average gain in participants' performance in the long jump. A two-sample t-test with a 5% level of significance will be used to analyze the results. If all else is kept the same, which of the following descriptions of a possible change in procedure is true?\nA. Change from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups would increase the power of the test.\nB. Change from a 5% significance level to a 1% significance level would increase the power of the test.\nC. Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would increase the power of the test.\nD. Increasing the sample size would reduce the probability of a Type I error.\nAnswer only the last question with a single letter only and put your final answer between <RESULT></RESULT> tag, output exactly the same as the tag I provided and do not say anything else other than the tag and your answer.",
