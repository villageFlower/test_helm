The following algorithm is intended to display the number of elements in the list that have a value greater than 100. The algorithm uses the variables count and position. Steps 3 and 4 are missing.\n Step 1: Set count to 0 and position to 1.\n Step 2: If the value of the element at index position is greater\n than 100, increase the value of count by 1.\n Step 3: (missing step)\n Step 4: (missing step)\n Step 5: Display the value of count.\n Which of the following could be used to replace steps 3 and 4 so that the algorithm works as intended?\nA. Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of count is greater than 100.\nB. Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until t he value of position is greater than n.\nC. Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of count is greater than 100.\n Step 4: Increase the value of position by 1.\nD. Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of position is greater than n.\n Step 4: Increase the value of count by 1.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: In the procedure Mystery below, the parameter number is a positive integer.\n\n PROCEDURE Mystery (number)\n {\n  REPEAT UNTIL (number <= 0)\n  {\n   number \u2190 number - 2\n  }\n  IF (number = 0)\n  {\n   RETURN (true)\n  }\n  ELSE\n  {\n   RETURN (false)\n  }\n }\n\n Which of the following best describes the result of running the procedure Mystery?\nA. The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is 2, and it otherwise returns false.\nB. The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is greater than 2, and it otherwise returns false.\nC. The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns false.\nD. The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is odd, and it otherwise returns false.\nAnswer only the last question with a single letter only and put your final answer between <RESULT></RESULT> tag, output exactly the same as the tag I provided and do not say anything else other than the tag and your answer.",
