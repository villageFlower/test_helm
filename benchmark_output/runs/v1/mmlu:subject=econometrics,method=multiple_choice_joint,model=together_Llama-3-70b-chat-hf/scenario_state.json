What is the optimal model order according to Akaike's information criterion?\nA. 1 lag\nB. 2 lags\nC. 3 lags\nD. 4 lags\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance\n\nyt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut\n\nThe (unconditional) mean of y will be given by\nA. 0.2\nB. 0.4\nC. 0.5\nD. 0.33\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?\n\n(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis\n\n(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used\n\n(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used\n\n(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\nB. (i) and (iii) only\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: What would be then consequences for the OLS estimator if heteroscedasticity is present in a regression model but ignored?\nA. It will be biased\nB. It will be inconsistent\nC. It will be inefficient\nD. All of (a), (b) and (c) will be true.\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: For a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will\nA. Eventually die away\nB. Persist indefinitely\nC. Grow exponentially\nD.
